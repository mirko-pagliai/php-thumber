*php-thumber* is a PHP library for creating thumbnails on the fly and it implements a file cache for thumbnails.
It uses [intervention/image](https://github.com/Intervention/image), working as wrapper.

Did you like this plugin? Its development requires a lot of time for me.

## Requirements and supported formats
*php-thumber* requires GD Library (>=2.0) **or** Imagick PHP extension
(>=6.5.7).

It's **highly preferable** to use Imagick, because It provides better
performance and a greater number of supported formats.

Supported formats may vary depending on the library used.

|         | JPEG | PNG | GIF | TIF | BMP | ICO | PSD |
|---------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| GD      | Yes  | Yes | Yes | No  | No  | No  | No  |
| Imagick | Yes  | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

For more information about supported format, please refer to the
[Intervention Image documentation](http://image.intervention.io/getting_started/formats).

## Installation and configuration
You can install the plugin via composer:
```bash
$ composer require --prefer-dist mirko-pagliai/php-thumber
```

Therefore, before using the library, it may be necessary to configure some constants:

*   `THUMBER_DRIVER`: the driver you want to use for the creation of thumbnails. Valid values are `imagick` or `gd`;
*   `THUMBER_TARGET`: full path directory where to create thumbnails (so you have to create this directory and make it writable).

An example:
```php
define('THUMBER_DRIVER', 'imagick');
define('THUMBER_TARGET', '/tmp/php-thumber');
```

Otherwise, you can include/require the [`config/bootstrap.php`](https://github.com/mirko-pagliai/php-thumber/blob/master/config/bootstrap.php) file, which will auto-determine the driver to use and set a temporary directory where to create thumbnails (on Unix environment, it will be `/tmp/php-thumber`).

### Installation on older PHP versions
Recent packages and the master branch require at least PHP 7.
Instead, the [php5.6](//github.com/mirko-pagliai/php-thumber/tree/php5.6) branch
requires at least PHP 5.6.

In this case, you can install the package as well:
```bash
$ composer require --prefer-dist mirko-pagliai/php-thumber:dev-php5.6
```

Note that the `php5.6` branch will no longer be updated as of April 22, 2021,
except for security patches, and it matches the
[1.2.3](https://github.com/mirko-pagliai/php-thumber/releases/tag/1.2.3) version.

## How to use
See our wiki:
*   [How to use ThumbCreator and create thumbnails](https://github.com/mirko-pagliai/php-thumber/wiki/How-to-use-ThumbCreator-and-create-thumbnails).

Refer to our [API](//mirko-pagliai.github.io/php-thumber).

## Testing
Some tests belong to the `imageEquals` group. These tests generate thubnails and compare them with pre-loaded thumbnails (inside `tests/examples/comparing_files`).
By default, these tests are not performed, because the images may be different if generated from different environments and systems.

To exclude these tests, you should run:
```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit --exclude-group imageEquals
```

## Versioning
For transparency and insight into our release cycle and to maintain backward
compatibility, *php-thumber* will be maintained under the
[Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org).
